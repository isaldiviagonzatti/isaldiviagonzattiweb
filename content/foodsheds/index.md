<h2> Safeguarding Food Security in Tamale: A Case Study </h2>

In the Tamale Metropolitan Area of Ghana (outlined in thick black on the map below), the LPJmL-Foodshed CIS provides crucial insights into food availability amid changing conditions. Tamale’s rapid growth, driven by internal and international migration, raises urgent questions about its food supply.

The map depicts maize production and population density in the Northern and Savannah regions. While the area around Tamale shows high population density, maize production varies, with some regions having substantial production and others none. The road network, shown in red, indicates the connectivity of high-production areas to Tamale.
The LPJmL-Foodshed tool will help analyze and visualize how Tamale’s Foodshed meets the city’s food demand now and in the future. Supporting adaptation planning aims to ensure a stable food supply. This tool offers a comprehensive view of regional vulnerabilities and opportunities, supporting decision-making for a resilient foodshed at both seasonal and decadal timescales.

As climate change continues to impact agricultural productivity and water resources, tools like the LPJmL model developed by Wageningen University & Research are essential. By integrating hydrological and crop simulations with socio-economic data, and applying the Foodshed concept, stakeholders can make informed decisions to safeguard food security. The case study in Tamale exemplifies how such tools can support regional planning and adaptation strategies, ensuring resilient food systems for the future.
