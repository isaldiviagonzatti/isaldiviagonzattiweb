    As a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Climate Studies from Wageningen University and a background in Economics from Complutense University, I am committed to advancing our understanding of the challenges posed by climate change and environmental degradation.

    Throughout my academic journey, I've actively contributed to scientific research in diverse areas such as climate adaptation, ocean sustainability, carbon dioxide removal, and circular economy. My experience extends to both quantitative and qualitative analyses, including statistical analysis, optimization modeling, geospatial data analysis, and stakeholder knowledge elicitation. Furthermore, I am a strong advocate for open science practices and am committed to transparency and collaboration in my work.

    My passion lies in finding scientific, innovative solutions to address the consequences of human activity on the environment and the effects of climate change on our communities. With over six years of work experience in diverse environments, I have built relevant technical soft skills. I enjoy both independent and collaborative work settings, valuing the opportunity to learn from clients and colleagues alike.

    I invite you to connect with me to explore potential collaborations and engage in meaningful discussions about how we can collectively address the pressing issues of climate change and environmental sustainability.
