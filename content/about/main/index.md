 Master's student at Wageningen University and intern at the IfW. Looking to help find scientific, innovative solutions to cope with the consequences of human activity on the environment and the effects of climate change on our communities.

 Topics of interest cover natural resources, waste, and climate economics. I enjoy working with econometrics, climate-economic modelling, and environmental economics theory.

 I have more than six years of work experience in different working environments, which helped me build professional and soft skills. Although I am very independent in my day-to-day work, I enjoy talking to clients and colleagues to learn from them and find solutions together.
