    ### Current Research

    I am a PhD candidate in the Earth Systems and Global Change group at Wageningen University & Research. My research focuses on integrating crop production with climate variability and change to create climate services that support stakeholders in making informed decisions about food availability planning. 
    
    I am working on expanding the foodsheds concept to build an integrated framework for food availability assessment that considers the interactions between food production, trade, and climate change at different spatial and temporal scales.
    
    My research is divided into four steps: (1) establishing a foodshed analysis framework to assess food availability, (2) developing a seasonal crop yield forecasting tool, (3) simulating long-term scenarios to assess integrated impacts on foodsheds, and (4) co-developing adaptation measures and evaluating the effectiveness of the Foodshed Climate Information Service.

    To achieve this, I combine crop-hydrological modeling (LPJmL), climate data, Shared Socio-economic Pathways, food trade data, and stakeholder knowledge.

    My research is part of the [SAFE4ALL](https://www.safe4allafrica.eu/) project, which aims to address the interconnected issues of food security, climate change, ecosystem and disaster management, and migration in three co-creation case studies: Kenya, Ghana, and Zimbabwe. 

    ### Background

    I hold a Master of Science in Climate Studies from Wageningen University and a Bachelor of Science in Economics from Complutense University. My academic journey has allowed me to contribute to scientific research in diverse areas such as climate adaptation, ocean sustainability, carbon dioxide removal, and the circular economy. 
    
    My experience extends to both quantitative and qualitative analyses, including statistical analysis, optimization modeling, geospatial data analysis, and stakeholder knowledge elicitation. I am a strong advocate for open science practices and am committed to transparency and collaboration in my research.
    
    ### Motivation

    My passion lies in finding scientific, innovative solutions to address the consequences of human activity on the environment and the effects of climate change on our communities. With over six years of work experience in diverse environments, I have developed relevant technical soft skills. I enjoy both independent and collaborative work settings, valuing the opportunity to learn from clients and colleagues alike.

    I invite you to connect with me to explore potential collaborations and engage in meaningful discussions about how we can collectively address the pressing issues of climate change and environmental sustainability.
