intro: | 
  I love nature, and I love understanding how society works. Thus, I decided to study economics and climate to help preserving society's dearest asset: the environment. I will soon finish my master's degree at Wageningen University and my goal is to help find scientific, innovative solutions to cope with the consequences of human activity on the environment and the effects of climate change on our communities. 
  
  To learn and to solve: the things I enjoy the most. I have more than five years of work experience in a dynamic, fresh environment, which helped me build professional and soft skills. 
  
  Although I am very independent in my day-to-day work, I enjoy talking to clients and colleagues to learn from them and find solutions together. Whether I am writing, modelling, doing statistical analysis, or research, I am detail-oriented and I have a strong work ethic. 
  
  Primarily, I care about what I do because I work to protect what I care about.
