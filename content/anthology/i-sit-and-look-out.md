| sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon
all oppression and shame

| hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish
with themselves, remorseful after deeds done,

| see in low life the mother misused by her children, dying,
neglected, gaunt,desperate

| see the wife misused by her husband, | see the treacherous
seducer of young women

| mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love
attempted to be hid, | see these sights on the earth

| see the workings of battle,pestilence,tyranny, | see martyrs
and prisoners,

| observe a famine at sea, | observe the sailors casting lots
who shall be kill’d to preserve the lives of the rest

| observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant
persons upon laborers, the poor, and upon negroes and the
like;

All these-all the meanness and agony without end | sitting
looking out upon,

See,hear,and am silent.
