(Translated from the Chinese)

One white, one red, one black
Three horses are drinking at the riverbank

They drink at their own pace, some up
Some down
Sometimes their heads reach the river

At the same time

As if a river were flowing
Out of their mouths

As their minds flow from the river source
Still innocent, clear, undisturbed

The sun is setting slowly
A man watches, without blinking

How a river disappears into the night
Held in the mouths of three horses
