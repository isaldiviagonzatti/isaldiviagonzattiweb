''Beyond this possibility looms a pressing moral imperative. These are times when the fabric of
society seems to unravel at ever-greater speed, when selfishness, violence, and a meanness of spirit
seem to be rotting the goodness of our communal lives. Here the argument for the importance of
emotional intelligence hinges on the link between sentiment, character, and moral instincts. There is
growing evidence that fundamental ethical stances in life stem from underlying emotional capacities.
For one, impulse is the medium of emotion; the seed of all impulse is a feeling bursting to express
itself in action. Those who are at the mercy of impulse-who lack self-control-suffer a moral
deficiency: The ability to control impulse is the base of will and character. By the same token, the root
of altruism lies in empathy, the ability to read emotions in others; lacking a sense of another's need or
despair, there is no caring. And if there are any two moral stances that our times call for, they are
precisely these, self-restraint and compassion.''


''In The Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle's philosophical enquiry into virtue, character, and the good
life, his challenge is to manage our emotional life with intelligence. Our passions, when well
exercised, have wisdom; they guide our thinking, our values, our survival. But they can easily go
awry, and do so all too often. As Aristotle saw, the problem is not with emotionality, but with the
appropriateness of emotion and its expression. The question is, how can we bring intelligence to our
emotions-and civility to our streets and caring to our communal life?''


"The beliefs of the rational mind are
tentative; new evidence can disconfirm one belief and replace it with a new one—it reasons by objective evidence. The emotional mind, however, takes its beliefs to be absolutely true, and so
discounts any evidence to the contrary. That is why it is so hard to reason with someone who is
emotionally upset: no matter the soundness of your argument from a logical point of view, it carries
no weight if it is out of keeping with the emotional conviction of the moment. Feelings are self-justifying, with a set of perceptions and "proofs" all their own."

The Past Imposed on the Present
"When some feature of an event seems similar to an emotionally charged memory from the past, the
emotional mind responds by triggering the feelings that went with the remembered event. The
emotional mind reacts to the present as though it were the past.® The trouble is that, especially when
the appraisal is fast and automatic, we may not realize that what was once the case is no longer so.
Someone who has learned, through painful childhood beatings, to react to an angry scowl with intense
fear and loathing will have that reaction to some degree even as an adult, when the scowl carries no
such threat."
