However, even "boredom" has its aura of mystery and is imbued with a singular pathos by Nietzsche. Boredom, from which art provides a refuge, becomes terrifying—the yawning abyss of being. When people  are bored, they regard the moment as an empty passage of time.  External events, as well as people's sense of self, become inconsequential. The phases of life lose their intentional tension and cave in on themselves like a soufflé removed from the oven too soon. Routines and  habits that otherwise provide stability suddenly prove to be nothing  more than façades. Finally, the eerie scenario of boredom reveals a  moment of true feeling. When people find nothing to do with themselves, nothingness besets them. Against this backdrop of nothingness,  art performs its task of self-stimulation—a virtually heroic enterprise,  because people on the verge of a breakdown need to be entertained. Art  steps in as a bridge to prevent succumbing to nihilist ennui. Art helps us  live; without it, life cannot stem the onslaught of meaninglessness.
