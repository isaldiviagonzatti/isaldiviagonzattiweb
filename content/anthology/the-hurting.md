1. when my mother opens her mouth
to have a conversation at dinner my
father shoves the word hush between
her lips and tells her to never speak
with her mouth full.

this is how the women in my family
learned to live with their mouths
closed.

2. you plough into me with two fingers
and i am mostly shocked. it feels like
rubber against an open wound. i do
not like it. you begin pushing faster
and faster. but i feel nothing. you
search my face for a reaction so i
begin acting like the naked women in
the videos you watch when you think
no one’s looking. i imitate their
moans. hollow and hungry. you ask if
it feels good and i say yes so quickly it
sounds rehearsed. but the acting. you
do not notice.
