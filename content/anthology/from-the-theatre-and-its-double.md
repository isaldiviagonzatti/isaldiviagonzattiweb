We cannot live forever surrounded by the dead and by death.

And if there are still prejudices, they must be destroyed.

THE DUTY

I say well

THE DUTY

of the writer, of the poet, it is not to cowardly shut oneself away in a text, a book,

a magazine of those who will never come out again, but rather go outside

to shake

to attack

to the public spirit

if not

What is it for?

And why was he/she born?
