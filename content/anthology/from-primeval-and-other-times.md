There are two kinds of learning, from
the inside and from the outside. The
first is regarded as the best, or even the
only kind. And so people learn through
distant journeys, watching, reading,
universities and lectures —- they learn
from what is happening outside them.
Man is a stupid creature who has to
learn. So he tacks knowledge onto him-
self, he gathers it like a bee, gaining
more and more of it, putting it to use
and processing it. But the thing inside
that is “stupid” and needs learning
doesn’t change.

Cornspike learned by absorbing
things from the outside to the inside.

Knowledge that is only grown on the
outside changes nothing inside a man,
or merely changes him on the surface,
as one garment is changed for another.
But he who learns by taking things in-
side himself undergoes constant trans-
formation, because he _ incorporates
what he learns into his being.
