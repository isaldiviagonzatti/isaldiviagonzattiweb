(Xia Jiangling)
(Translated from Chinese)

A sea of colorful clouds  
Was there to see me off,  
The world awaits,  
As I Li Bai,  
Left Baidi.  
It was the crack of dawn.  
It was three hundred miles,  
To reach Jiangling,  
A thousand li,  
If one counts in Chinese.  
Along the way, on both banks,  
Monkeys spoke.  
I am not sure why,  
Or what they said,  
I am not sure why I bring it up.  
It makes more sense  
To say  
They laughed,  
To see this sight,  
Beneath ten thousand towering mountains  
A little boat bobbing  
On the mighty Yangtze
