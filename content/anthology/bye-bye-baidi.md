**Bye Bye Baidi, by Li Ba** i

**Here’s a tongue in cheek translation.**

**Bye Bye Baidi, by Li Bai  
下江陵  
Xia Jiangling  
**  
A sea of colorful clouds  
Was there to see me off,  
The world awaits,  
As I Li Bai,  
Left Baidi.  
It was the crack of dawn.  
It was three hundred miles,  
To reach Jiangling,  
A thousand li,  
If one counts in Chinese.  
Along the way, on both banks,  
Monkeys spoke.  
I am not sure why,  
Or what they said,  
I am not sure why I bring it up.  
It makes more sense  
To say  
They laughed,  
To see this sight,  
Beneath ten thousand towering mountains  
A little boat bobbing  
On the mighty Yangtze  
**— Li Bai 李白**, more or less  

**The Title**

What’s in a name? Witter Brynner calls the title “Through the Yangzi Gorges.” Yangtze is now the accepted English spelling and there are three gorges along the Yangtze. And Baidicheng a city on the mountainside lies at the entrance. But, as you can see from the literal translation below, Li Bai called his poem **Xia Jiangling**, or Descending to Jiangling. Going down river to Jiangling, if one wants to stretch it out.

**The Time**

Li Bai’s diary consists of his poems. From them we take clues to date the when and where of each poem. This poem may have been written as early as 725 when Li Bai was in his mid-twenties. Li Bai had left his home in Sichuan province to being his days of wandering. It describes a young poet sent off in a haze of colorful clouds, sailing down the Yangtze River through Lake Dongting to Jiangling, the gateway to the North and East.

I am not sure why the monkeys cried. **聲 sheng** could mean chatter, so maybe they engaged in idle gossip.

**“Who is this upstart trying to make waves in such a tiny boat.”**

In ancient Chinese poetry, mountains served as a metaphor for a long hard journey, as well as spiritual enlightenment. It’s a long, long way to fame and glory in such a tiny, little boat.

**Descending to Jiangling**  
Baidi, at dawn, is clothed in colorful clouds,  
In one day I sailed a thousand li to Jiangling.  
On the banks the monkeys spoke along the way,  
While my tiny little boat passes ten thousand mountains.  
— Li Bai, circa 725

**Original Chinese text and pinyin**

| **Descending to Jiangling** | **下江陵** | **Xià Jiānglíng** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A morning farewell to Baidi, in the thick of colorful clouds,   It takes one day to reach Jiangling, a journey of a thousand miles. | 朝辭白帝彩雲間，   千里江陵一日還。 | Cháo cí bái dì cǎiyún jiān,   qiānlǐ Jiānglíng yī rì hái. |
| On both sides of the river the monkeys cry never stopped.   Until my tiny boat passed ten thousands mountains. | 兩岸猿聲啼不住，   輕舟已過萬重山。 | Liǎng’àn yuán shēng tí bù zhù,   qīngzhōu yǐguò wàn chóngshān. |

**江陵** **Jiangling**, the historical name of Jingzhou, Hubei province. It gets you through the Three Gorges into Central China. From there one can go North or East.

**Bye Bye Bye** is a reference to the Song by the Boy Band NSYNC, 2000. It is there for no particular reason.
