    *I Go Down To The Shore*

    I go down to the shore in the morning

    and depending on the hour the waves

    are rolling in or moving out,

    and I say, oh, I am miserable,

    what shallâ€”

    what should I do? And the sea says

    in its lovely voice:

    Excuse me, I have work to do.
